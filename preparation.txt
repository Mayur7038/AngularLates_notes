1. Tell About YourSelf:- I’m a Full Stack Developer with around 3.5 years of experience, 
currently working at Egreens Farms Pvt. Ltd., where I build and maintain scalable web and mobile applications using the MEAN stack.
I primarily work with Angular on the frontend and Node.js with Express on the backend, building REST APIs, real-time features, 
and integrating third-party services like Google Maps and payment gateways.
Recently, I implemented a real-time chatbot system that allows users to raise queries and chat live with a Customer Service Manager using WebSockets,
 which helped improve customer engagement and reduced support response time.
I’ve worked end-to-end on multiple products I’m now looking to grow in a role where I can take more ownership and work on complex full-stack challenges.

2. Tell me about your current role
In my current role as a MEAN Stack Developer, I work on building and maintaining business-critical applications for customers, delivery riders, and internal teams.
I develop Angular-based UIs, design Node.js APIs, work with MongoDB, and implement features like real-time tracking, chat systems, and admin dashboards.
I’m also involved in performance optimization, bug fixing, and production support.


3. What kind of projects have you worked on?
I’ve worked on multiple large-scale applications including customer-facing apps, delivery rider apps, admin panels, and marketing dashboards.
These applications handle real-time data such as order tracking, live chat, and delivery status updates.
One of the notable projects was a real-time customer support chatbot, where users could raise queries and chat directly with support managers inside the app.
