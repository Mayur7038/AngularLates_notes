Interceptors are generally functions which you can run for each request, and 
have broad capabilities to affect the contents and overall flow of requests and responses. 
You can install multiple interceptors, which form an interceptor chain 
where each interceptor processes the request or response before forwarding it to the next interceptor in the chain.



You can use interceptors to implement a variety of common patterns, such as:

Adding authentication headers to outgoing requests to a particular API.
Retrying failed requests with exponential backoff.
Caching responses for a period of time, or until invalidated by mutations.
Customizing the parsing of responses.
Measuring server response times and log them.
Driving UI elements such as a loading spinner while network operations are in progress.
Collecting and batch requests made within a certain timeframe.
Automatically failing requests after a configurable deadline or timeout.
Regularly polling the server and refreshing results.
