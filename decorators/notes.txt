Decorators are special functions that modify the behaviour of classes or class members (properties, methods, etc.).
Decorators are used to add metadata to classes so that the Angular compiler can process them appropriately.

In Angular, decorators can be broadly categorized into four main types:

1.Class decorators
2.Property decorators
3.Method decorators
4.Parameter decorators



1.Class decorators :-
In Angular, class decorators are used to annotate and modify classes. 
Class decorators are functions that can be applied to a class declaration,
 typically prefixed with the @ symbol. These decorators execute when the class is defined, 
 providing a way to extend or modify the behaviour of the class.

 @Component,@Injectable,@Directive and @NgModule are widely used class decorators.


 2. Property Decorators

 Property decorators in angular are used to annotate and modify class properties.
  They are applied to the property declarations directly. 
  Property decorators are invoked at runtime with the target object (instance of the class) and property name.

@Input()  , @Output() , @HostBinding



3. Method Decorators
Method decorators in angular are used to annotate and modify class methods.
They are applied to the method declarations directly.
Method decorators are invoked at runtime with the target object (instance of the class),
the property name (method name), and a property descriptor.

@ViewChild,@ContentChild,@HostListener are widely used method decorators.

// viewChild helps us to access the methods of children component also

// ContentChild : Used to get reference of content projected from the parent into the child component (through <ng-content>).
(it usefull like for passing content like text from parent to child element)

// @HostListener() allows you to listen to DOM events directly on:
The host element of a component/directive, or
Global targets like window, document, or body.


4. Parameter Decorators (look)

Parameter decorators are special Angular decorators that are applied to constructor parameters (function parameters), not to properties or methods.
They tell Angular’s Dependency Injection (DI) system how to resolve dependencies for that parameter when creating an instance of 
a class (component, service, directive, etc.).

Parameter decorators tell Angular what to inject and how to inject it into a constructor.

@Host,@Inject,@Self,@SkipSelf are widely used parameter decorators.  

| Decorator     | Purpose                                                                            | Example                                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `@Inject()`   | Specifies a **custom injection token** for a parameter.                            | `constructor(@Inject(MY_TOKEN) value: any)`         |
| `@Optional()` | Makes a dependency **optional** (no error if not provided).                        | `constructor(@Optional() logger?: LoggerService)`   |
| `@Self()`     | Limits the injector to **current injector only** (doesn’t check parent injectors). | `constructor(@Self() service: MyService)`           |
| `@SkipSelf()` | Skips the current injector and looks **up the injector tree**.                     | `constructor(@SkipSelf() parentService: MyService)` |
| `@Host()`     | Restricts resolution to the **host element’s injector** (stops at host).           | `constructor(@Host() hostService: MyService)`       |
