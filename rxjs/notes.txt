1. what is observalbe  :-
Observable is a stream of asynchronous data that emits values over time and allows subscription,
cancellation, and powerful data manipulation using RxJS operators.

Operators are functions that allow you to transform or manipulate Observables in various ways. 

2. Why Observables are used?

    Handle async operations like:
    HTTP API calls

    User events (clicks, input)
    WebSockets

    Support real-time data
    Provide powerful operators like map, filter, switchMap

3.Key Characteristics

Lazy → executes only when subscribed
Can emit:
next() → data
error() → error
complete() → completion
Can be cancelled using unsubscribe()

4.Observable vs Promise (Common Interview Point)
Observable	            Promise
Emits multiple values	Emits single value
Lazy	                Eager
Can be cancelled    	Cannot be cancelled
Supports operators	    Limited chaining




1. Observable (The Producer)
An Observable is a blueprint for a data stream that emits values over time.
 It is lazy (it doesn't start until someone subscribes) and can push three types of notifications: data (next), errors (error), or completion (complete).

2. Observer (The Consumer)
An Observer is an object containing a set of callbacks that listen to an Observable.
 It defines how to react to the data, errors, or completion signals received from the source.


3. Operator (The Processer)
An Operator is a pure function that takes an Observable as input and returns a new Observable as output.
 They allow you to transform, filter, or combine data streams without modifying the original source.
