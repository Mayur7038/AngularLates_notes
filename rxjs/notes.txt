1. what is observalbe  :-
Observable is a stream of asynchronous data that emits values over time and allows subscription,
cancellation, and powerful data manipulation using RxJS operators.

2. Why Observables are used?

    Handle async operations like:
    HTTP API calls

    User events (clicks, input)
    WebSockets

    Support real-time data
    Provide powerful operators like map, filter, switchMap

3.Key Characteristics

Lazy → executes only when subscribed
Can emit:
next() → data
error() → error
complete() → completion
Can be cancelled using unsubscribe()

4.Observable vs Promise (Common Interview Point)
Observable	            Promise
Emits multiple values	Emits single value
Lazy	                Eager
Can be cancelled    	Cannot be cancelled
Supports operators	    Limited chaining
